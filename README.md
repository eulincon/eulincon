### Hi there 👋

My name is Lincon Brito from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Full-Stack Web Developer. I'm passionate about open source projects, and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my beginning career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, React.js and AI with Python.



Would you like to find me?

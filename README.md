### Hi there 👋

My name is Lincon Brito from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Full-Stack Web Developer. I'm passionate about open source projects, and I've always loved to produce a lot of content during my beginning career.

In my free time I like to play (and watch) soccer (⚽️), to watch movies (🎞️) and series (📺), to read books (📚), to listen to music (🎵) and eventually I like to philosophize about life with a beer (🍺).

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Django, React.js and AI with Python.
- Tinkering with interactions on <a href="https://codepen.io/zlincon"> Codepen</a> 🏓

- Generation of software developers to change the world with code.

My litle projects:
- Game Survey - SDS1 - https://game-survey-sds1.netlify.app (Reacts.js & Java Spring)
- DS DElivery - SDS2 - https://sds2-dsdeliver.netlify.app (React.js & Java Spring)
- Communicart - https://communicart.netlify.app (React.js & Java Spring)
- Proffy - NLW - https://friendly-aryabhata-80a4df.netlify.app (React.js)
- Linconflix - Alura - https://linconflix.vercel.app (React.js)
